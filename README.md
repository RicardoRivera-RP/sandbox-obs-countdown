This is a basic overlay package for SandboxRP streamers.

To adjust the personal discord overlay with your own discord link, you will need to open the personal_discord.html file in text editor or any code-editing software you may have and replace the discord link in line 31 with your own link.

Example of the code you need to edit for the personal discord overlay:
<div id="invite">Join My Discord: <br> discord.gg/your-discord-link-here</div>
